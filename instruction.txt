 How to Use the Prototype
Dependencies: Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install pyserial

Server Setup:

Modify server.py: Change the COM port names (COM3, COM4) to match your system's serial ports.

Run the server: Execute python server.py. It will start listening for connections.

Client Usage:

Modify client.py: Ensure the host and port match the server's configuration.

Run the client: Execute python client.py. It will connect to the server, send messages to each channel, and print the server's responses.

This prototype demonstrates the key concepts: a centralized server handling serial I/O and a separate client for application-level communication. The use of JSON-based messaging allows for a flexible and extensible protocol.
